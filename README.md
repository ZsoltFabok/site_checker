Site Checker is a simple ruby gem, which helps you check the integrity of your website by recursively visiting the referenced pages and images. I use it in my test environments to make sure that my websites don't have any dead links.

### Install

    gem install site_checker

### Usage

#### Default

First, you have to load the `site_checker` by adding this line to the file where you would like to use it:

    require 'site_checker'

If you want to use it for testing, the line should goto the `test_helper.rb`.

The usage is quite simple:

    check_site("http://localhost:3000/app", "http://localhost:3000")
    puts collected_remote_pages.inspect
    puts collected_local_pages.inspect
    puts collected_remote_images.inspect
    puts collected_local_images.inspect
    puts collected_problems.inspect

The snippet above will open the `http://localhost:3000/app` link and will look for links and images. If it finds a link to a local page, it will recursively checkout out that page, too. The second argument - `http://localhost:3000` - defines the starting reference of your website.

In case you don't want to use a DSL like API you can still do the following:

    SiteChecker.check("http://localhost:3000/app", "http://localhost:3000")
    puts SiteChecker.remote_pages.inspect
    puts SiteChecker.local_pages.inspect
    puts SiteChecker.remote_images.inspect
    puts SiteChecker.local_images.inspect
    puts SiteChecker.problems.inspect

### Using on Generated Content
If you have a static website (e.g. generated by [octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress)) you can tell `site_checker` to use folders from the file system. With this approach, you don't need a webserver for verifying your website:

    check_site("./public", "./public")
    puts collected_problems.inspect

### Configuration
You can instruct `site_checker` to ignore certain links:

    SiteChecker.configure do |config|
      config.ignore_list = ["/", "/atom.xml"]
    end

By default it won't check the conditions of the remote links and images - e.g. 404 or 500 -, but you can change it like this:

    SiteChecker.configure do |config|
      config.visit_references = true
    end

Too deep recursive calls may be expensive, so you can configure the maximum depth of the recursion with the following attribute:

    SiteChecker.configure do |config|
      config.max_recursion_depth = 3
    end

### Examples
Make sure that there are no local dead links on the website (I'm using [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) syntax):

    before(:each) do
      SiteChecker.configure do |config|
        config.ignore_list = ["/atom.xml", "/rss"]
      end
    end

    it "should not have dead local links" do
      check_site("http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:3000")
      # this will print out the difference and I don't have to re-run with print
      collected_problems.should be_empty
    end

Check that all the local pages can be reached with maximum two steps:

    before(:each) do
      SiteChecker.configure do |config|
        config.ignore_list = ["/atom.xml", "/rss"]
        config.max_recursion_depth = 2
      end

      @number_of_local_pages = 100
    end

    it "all the local pages have to be visited" do
      check_site("http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:3000")
      collected_local_pages.size.should eq @number_of_local_pages
    end

### Troubleshooting
#### undefined method 'new' for SiteChecker:Module
This error occurs when the test code calls v0.1.1 methods, but a newer version of the gem has already been installed. Update your test code following the examples above.
